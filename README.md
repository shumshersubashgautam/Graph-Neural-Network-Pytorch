**Graph Neural Networks**
1. Pytorch Geometric Framework

Understanding Message Passing Scheme in Pytorch Geometric.
Efficient graph data representations and paralleling minibatching graphs.
Showcase the implementation of Graph Convolution Networks (Kipf & Welling, SEMI-SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION WITH GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS, ICLR 2017), and you should implement GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al, Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs, NIPS 2017) in the lab based on message passing scheme.
2. Vertex Classification

Showcase a model developed based on our GCN implementation to do vertex classification on Cora dataset.
Develop a model with your own GraphSAGE (with mean/sum/max aggregation) implementation on the same dataset to get insights of difference.
3. Graph Classification

Implement GINConv (Xu et al, HOW POWERFUL ARE GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS?, ICLR 2019) on graph classification benchmark dataset (IMDB) and compare different aggregation functions (SUM/MEAN/MAX).
